"""Per-request NaN containment for the model executor.

Models and kernels cannot be assumed 100% NaN-free. This guard records
*which* requests produced NaN logits (or an out-of-vocab token id),
sanitizes the logits in place, and ships a per-request flag tensor to the
CPU where the output processor terminates the flagged requests with
``ABORT_CODE.NumericalError``.

Design constraints (all hold by construction):

- **Graph-safe / no sync.** Fixed-shape device ops on a persistent flag
  buffer; flags OR in-graph and are zeroed once per step outside it, so
  multi-cycle decode graphs accumulate correctly.
- **Near-zero cost.** Detection is one fused ``amax`` reduction over the
  logits (NaN propagates through ``amax``; no ``[rows, vocab]`` mask) plus
  ops on ``[bs]``-sized vectors; sanitize is one ``nan_to_num_``.
- **Rank-consistent.** OOV flags derive from already-broadcast token ids;
  logits flags rely on the bit-identical-logits-per-rank assumption the
  conditional sampling broadcast already depends on.
- **Zero branching at call sites.** ``NanGuard.create`` returns a no-op
  singleton when disabled.

Limitation: with Batch-DP spec-verify sampling the logits arrive sharded
(``logits_layout_plan is not None``), so logits attribution is skipped for
those steps; sanitize still applies and the OOV backstop still covers the
gathered full-batch ids.
