"""Every K3 MoE tail tier must produce the same answer.

The selector routes a forward to one of the tail tiers by token count and
graph phase, so which arithmetic runs depends on batch size and whether a CUDA
graph is replaying. An end-to-end eval only ever exercises the tiers its own shapes
happen to select — GPQA at ebs8 never reaches SEPARATE_REDUCE, and nothing in
the decode path reaches MULTIMEM_AR. This file compares the tiers against each
other directly on identical inputs, which is what makes a tier-specific
numerical defect visible at all.

The tiers are driven through ``K3MoeTailComm``'s own ``_tail_*`` methods, on an
instance built by ``__new__`` with only the attributes those methods read
(the collective negotiation in ``K3MoeTailCommState`` is deliberately
bypassed). That matters: a test that re-derived norm+projection in torch
would agree with itself no matter what ``routed_norm``,
``kimi3_latent_projection_add3``, ``kimi3_join_reduce_moe`` or the fused
kernel's epilogue actually computed. Only ``mapping``, ``execution_plan`` and
``state`` are stand-ins — they carry group and policy configuration, no
arithmetic.

The tolerance is deliberately loose, and not because any tier accumulates in
bf16 — none does; every dot product runs in fp32. The paths differ in the
order their collective sums the sixteen bf16 partials (in-switch ld_reduce vs
NCCL), and in where intermediates round back to bf16: the fused kernel rounds
its GEMM result before adding the shared partial specifically so it matches
the unfused chain's rounding. Bitwise agreement is therefore not expected;
agreement within bf16 noise is.

``test_selector_boundaries`` is pure Python and runs in ordinary one-GPU CI.
Everything else needs the collective; exercise it with:
``torchrun --standalone --nproc-per-node=8 -m pytest -q <this file>``.
