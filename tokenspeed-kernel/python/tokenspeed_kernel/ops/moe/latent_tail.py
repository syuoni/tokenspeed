"""Multicast latent-MoE tail for Kimi-K3 decode.

Replaces the ``all-reduce(latent+shared lanes) -> replicated up-projection``
tail with three fused stages: one kernel doing AR(latent)+RMSNorm+RS(shared),
a *sharded* up-projection (each rank computes ``hidden/tp`` rows — 1/tp of the
weight traffic, and 1/tp of the weight storage when the caller passes a
column-parallel weight) whose epilogue multicast-stores the shard into every
rank's mailbox (NVLS), and a barrier-free Lamport gather. Symmetric buffers
come from stock ``torch.distributed._symmetric_memory``. A depth-d rotation
pool (d=2 by default) reduces their footprint from about 0.95 GB per rank for
roughly 92 MoE layers to d x about 6 MB per rank. The small per-call staging
can come from the runtime's shared workspace pool via ``scratch_allocator``.

    at group granularity: a node-local subgroup of a multi-host job never

    NVLink on a machine with no fabric at all.

    Size alone does not establish node-locality, and neither does alignment to

    beside the fabric verdict. Nothing is divided out of the visible device
    count here: a job running fewer workers than a host has GPUs puts two hosts
    inside one such window, and the group would skip the fabric test entirely.
