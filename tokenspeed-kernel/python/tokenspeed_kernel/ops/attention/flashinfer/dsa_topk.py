"""Deterministic DSA decode indexer top-k via flashinfer.

The trtllm ``indexer_topk_decode`` kernel breaks ties (equal logits competing for
the last selected slot) non-deterministically: repeated runs select *different*
index sets, which makes long-context greedy decode irreproducible and breaks
eager-vs-CUDA-graph parity. flashinfer's radix top-k exposes a stable,
index-ordered tie-break plus a graph-safe path, so the selection is identical
across eager, repeated runs, and CUDA-graph replay -- with zero accuracy loss
(it still selects the mathematically-correct top-k set, only the tie-break and
output order become deterministic).
