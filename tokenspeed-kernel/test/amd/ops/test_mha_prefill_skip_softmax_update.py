"""The skip decision is per row, but only a unanimous block changes anything.

On a block where at least one row dissents, the per-row votes are discarded and
every row takes the ordinary online-softmax update. That is the contract pinned
here, and the easy one to get wrong: dropping a dissenting block for the rows
that did vote is both less accurate and slower, since holding a row's max back
makes it less likely to vote on later blocks. The authors' own Hopper kernel
in TensorRT-LLM discards the per-row bits the same way.

Checks (bf16, causal, fixed seed):
  [1] VOTES ARE INERT   thresholds where many rows vote but no block is
      unanimous give output bit-identical to a threshold too small for any
      row to vote, across GQA ratios, sinks, LSE, sliding window and ragged
      batch
  [2] ELISION FIRES     past that range the output does move, so [1] is not
      vacuously true of a kernel that skips nothing
  [3] NO REGRESSION     with skipping off, the result matches dense SDPA

How far the elided output may drift is covered by
``test_mha_prefill_skip_softmax.py``.
